# WarBoard. A Foxhole themed project 
This project is a physical board displaying the current status of capture towns of a single hex from the game [Foxhole](https://www.foxholegame.com/). Inspired by [Foxholestats.com](https://foxholestats.com/). Powered by Foxhole's [WarAPI](https://github.com/clapfoot/warapi) and a Raspberry Pi running Python.

The WarBoard will display each capture town in the Deadlands hex with WS2812 LEDs, with corresponding colors matching the factions colors. The LEDs are planned to blink each time a town changes sides, allowing for a quick overview of the war's progress. Finally a casualties pr. hour display will track the activity in the hex.

*This project is currently under development. The goal is to include build files, demo data, and a detailed explanation in how it's built and works*
